This is a volunteer project by members of the [Data Analysis and Visualization Group](http://vis.uni.kn) and the [Visual Computing Group](https://www.cgmi.uni-konstanz.de/en/) at the [University of Konstanz](http://uni.kn).

The live version is available at [https://coronavis.dbvis.de](https://coronavis.dbvis.de).

CoronaVis visualizes intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacities of German hospitals (provided by [DIVI](https://divi.de)) as well as data from the COVID-19 pandemic (provided by [Robert Koch Institut](https://rki.de)).
